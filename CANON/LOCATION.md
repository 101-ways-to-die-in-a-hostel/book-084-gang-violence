### The Death Location (Specific)
**The Street Outside:** Rua da Paz (ironic name) runs between two territories. The hostel is on the east side, Cobra territory. The west side starts at the blue building 50 meters away. Oliver is shot 30 meters from the hostel door, on the invisible line between territories. The spot is now marked with a small memorial that no one visits.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Maria Santos
**Description:** 40-year-old lifelong resident, fiercely protective of guests and community. Has buried too many young people. Speaks truth even when tourists don't want to hear it.
**Role in death:** Tried repeatedly to warn Oliver; held him as he died

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Dona Celeste | Oliver's "project" - he was teaching her English |
| Security | None | Can't afford it; Maria handles what she can |
| Cook | Community volunteers | Rotating duty |
| Manager | Pedro Almeida | Founder; often away fundraising |

### Staff Knowledge
They know exactly where the boundaries are. They know which gang controls which block. They've negotiated the hostel's neutrality carefully. Oliver threatened all of that.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Volunteers working on projects. Kids from the neighborhood using the computer room. Cautious optimism mixed with hypervigilance.

### Night Vibe
Early lockdown (9 PM). Doors barred. Quiet conversation. The unspoken tension of listening for trouble. Guests who stay long enough learn to read the sounds.

### Guest Demographics
Voluntourists (like Oliver), development workers, journalists, researchers, and very adventurous backpackers. No party crowd.

### Reputation
TripAdvisor: 3.5 stars - "Life-changing experience, follow the rules, not for everyone"
Lonely Planet: Not listed (too dangerous to recommend)
Word of mouth: "Only if you're serious about community work"

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Taxi to the edge of the neighborhood, walk the last 200m (taxi won't enter). Or Uber that lies about the destination. Call ahead and Maria will watch for you.

### Check-in Process
Extensive safety orientation. Map showing where not to go. Phone numbers to memorize. "We're not trying to scare you, we're trying to keep you alive."

### Rules
- No leaving after dark
- Don't photograph people without asking
- Don't go past the blue building EVER
- Check in with staff before going anywhere
- No gang colors (red or blue) in clothing

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Salvador's gang violence is real and ongoing. Territorial boundaries are meaningful. Outsiders who don't understand local dynamics are at genuine risk. Many community organizations do important work while navigating these dangers.

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Show favela residents as complex people, not just poverty/violence stereotypes
- Maria and other locals are the heroes, not the victim
- Critique Oliver's saviorism while acknowledging his genuine (misguided) desire to help
- Don't sensationalize Brazilian violence for foreign audiences

### Sources
- Academic studies on gang territories in Brazilian cities
- Journalism from favela-based reporters
- Nonprofit organizations working in similar areas
- Accounts from voluntourists who learned hard lessons
